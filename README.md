# Coworkers

### A service to figure out who you're coworking with.

### Info
* Coworkers is a service for people using a coworking space to see who else is present, what those people specialize in, and if they're available or currently busy. A secondary use for the service is to allow people who are off-site to see who is around their preferred coworking space.
