# Coworkers

### A service to figure out who you're coworking with.

### Info
* Coworkers is a platform for people currently using a coworking space to see who else is present, what those people specialize in, and if/how long they are available. A secondary use for the service is to allow people who are off-site to see who is around their preferred coworking space.
